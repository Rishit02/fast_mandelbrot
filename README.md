# fast_mandelbrot

What this app does?

Generates the Mandelbrot fractal twice—once with pure-Python code, once with an accelerated Cython extension.

Measures runtime and displays:
– Execut
– Speed-up factor (Python ÷ Cython).

Renders both images side-by-side for an immediate visual check.

Launch the app using:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
